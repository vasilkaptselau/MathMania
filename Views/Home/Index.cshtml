        <h2>How does it help the Teachers:</h2>
        <p>
            Teachers will be able to log in and view the students progress to
            determine where the student is excelling and where an individual might
            need help. Teachers can also view statistics on the entire class to
            determine if there are any areas that need to be revisited during
            lesson time.
